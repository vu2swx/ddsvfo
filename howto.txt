A simple DDS VFO

  The DDS VFO  is based on arduino and cheap chinese DDS modules.
   
     Parts needed.
             Arduino UNO   
             AD9850 DDS module
             Rotary Encoder
             Pushbutton Switch.


  The code is self explanatory and it uses the following libraries.
  Quadencoder library
 https://github.com/medecau/QuadEncoder
  Bounce    http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/Bounce
  
I wrote this for my own use and if there is sufficient interest I can write better documentation and  improve the code.
